## What's OpenStack ?

OpenStack is an open source platform that lets you build an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
cloud that runs on commodity hardware

## History - OpenStack in Fedora

* openstack-nova Diablo imported to Fedora 16 in August 2011 [1]
* Until now we were able to keep Fedora/OpenStack release 1:1 [2]
  + Fedora 16 includes OpenStack Diablo
  + Fedora 17 includes OpenStack Essex
  + Fedora 18 includes OpenStack Folsom
  + Fedora 19 includes OpenStack Grizzly
  + Fedora 20 includes OpenStack Havana
  + Fedora 21 includes OpenStack Icehouse
  + Fedora 22 includes OpenStack Juno
  + Fedora 23 includes OpenStack Kilo
  + Starting Fedora 24/Liberty, we only support DLRN builds for Fedora

## History - OpenStack in RHEL/CentOS

* Nova added to EPEL6 in November 2011
* complete Essex update in April 2012 [1]
* incompatible Folsom update in October 2012 [2] sparked conversations
leading to the creation of RDO [3]
* RDO started with Grizzly in April 2013
* Since September, 2014 RDO is part of the CentOS Cloud SIG

# OpenStack Packaging Challenges

---
class: middle

## Targets

* Focusing on RHEL/CentOS 7 (starting Kilo)
* Fedora supported through DLRN

---
class: middle

## Multiple Releases

* Kilo (soon to be EOL) => may 2015
* Liberty (previous stable) => october 2015
* Mitaka (current stable) => april 2016
* Newton (master)

---
class: middle

## Many packages

For instance CentOS 7 Mitaka RC3

OpenStack:

* 353 binary packages
* 127 source packages
  + 41 for services & Horizon plugins
  + 24 for clients

Dependencies:

* 5607 binary packages (5044 being texlive modules from a single source package)
* 311 source packages (234 being python modules)

# RDO Infrastructure

---
class: middle

## Git

* Currently hosted on @openstack-packages github organization
* A single spec per release on one branch
  + rpm-master => DLRN (Newton)
  + rpm-mitaka => DLRN (Mitaka)
  + rpm-liberty => DLRN (Liberty)
  + rdo-mitaka => CentOS/RHEL (Mitaka)
  + rdo-liberty => CentOS/RHEL (Liberty)
* Same spec is used to be built on multiple targets

---
class: middle

## Buildsystem Setup

* RDO trunk builds are available for Fedora and EL7 through DLRN
* RDO for Enterprise Linux is built in CentOS Community Build System and is self-contained

---
class: middle

## Packaging/Patches review

* Using gerrit like OpenStack upstream
* Patches and packaging changes runs through a review
* [Hosted on gerrithub](https://review.gerrithub.io/#/q/project:openstack-packages)
* Trigger a serie of CI jobs

---
class: middle

## DLRN

DLRN is a Continuous Delivery platform that take every upstream commit and build it as a
consumable package for CI purpose.

```bash
+------------+    +---------+    +------------+    +-------------------+
|            |    |         |    |            |    |                   |
| New commit +----> current +----> consistent +----> current+passed+ci |
|            |    |         |    |            |    |                   |

## DLRN CI

```bash
+------------+    +---------+    +------------+    +-------------------+
|            |    |         |    |            |    |                   |
| New commit +----> current +----> consistent +----> current+passed+ci |
|            |    |         |    |            |    |                   |
+------------+    +---------+    +-----^------+    +---------^---------+
                                       |                     |
                                       |                     |
                                 +-----+------+    +---------+---------+
                                 |   RDO CI   |    |    Upstream CI    |
                                 +------------+    +-------------------+
```

* master: every commit or almost is built
* consistent: set of packages without build failures
* current-passed-ci: snapshot that passed CI
* stable releases: packages from upstream tagged tarballs + sanity checks

* RDO CI targets consistent snapshots
* Upstream CI projects targets current-passed-ci (e.g. packstack, tripleO, kolla, puppet)

## WeiRDO

* Ansible-based framework using gate jobs and make them usable outside upstream gates
* Goal is to improve coverage upon what upstream provides.

* Weekly IRC meetings on freenode ([agenda](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting))
* Creation of RDO Eng. team to support and foster contributions (ping apevec or hguemar to get
started!)
* __RDO Eng. is the only team that has no internal meetings, all in the open!__
* Open roadmap ([RDO public trello](https://trello.com/b/HhXlqdiu/rdo))

---
class: middle

## Why?

* RDO has been founded as a self-supporting community distribution of OpenStack for Fedora/RHEL ecosystem
* Enable community contributors collaboration
* Allow community to choose the direction of the project

---
class: middle

## A lot more contributions from non-redhatters

Some highlights:

* Juno/EL6 builds thanks to Thomas Oulevey (CERN)
* Barbican packages thanks to Greg Swift (Rackspace)
* GBP packages thanks to Robert Kukura (Cisco)
* app-catalog-ui thanks to Kevin Fox
* Murano/Congress/Mistral thanks to Marcos Fermin Lobo (CERN)
* Networking backends contributed by Cisco, Bigswitch, Midonet

class: middle

## RDO 💓 CentOS

* RDO starting Kilo is fully built on CBS
* One of the first usable product by a SIG
* Considering moving more bits of RDO infrastructure over CentOS

---
class: middle

## RDO mid-cycle meetup

* Full day meetup during FOSDEM
* Co-located with FOSDEM CentOS dojo
* Discussion on planning and future organization

---
class: middle

## Big tent plans

* A lot of interests in maintaining non-core projects in RDO
* RDO Eng. will be supporting community efforts as long as there is commitment
* Note that won't impact RHOSP

## Packaging as an upstream project

* [Proposal cooked up at Vancouver Summit](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/185187/)
* We're 100% behind it
* Currently discussing with Suse guys on how we could converge RPM packaging
* Not a disruptive change to us as we've been working on two releases using a very
similar workflow (DLRN + gerrithub)

---
class: middle

## Operational tools

* Bringing mature and advanced operational tools to RDO
  + Centralised Logging
  + Performance Monitoring
  + Availability Monitoring
* Led by Graeme Gillies

[Discussion on RDO list](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00051.html)

## OPNFV

* CentOS OPNFV SIG 
* Build a vanilla OPNFV platform based on OpenStack + OpenDaylight (ODL)
* First release based w/ RDO and Foreman installer coming soon
* CI + functional testing in progress
* Ping Dan Radez if you want to get involved

---
class: middle

## Trystack

* Public RDO cloud available to try out OpenStack (backed by the Foundation)
* Kilo migration: WiP
* Kilo version will include Manila + Trove
* RDO CI runs over Juno
* Recruiting more operators to manage this effort!
