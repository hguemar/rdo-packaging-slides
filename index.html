## What's OpenStack ?

OpenStack is an open source platform that lets you build an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
cloud that runs on commodity hardware

## What's RDO

RDO is a freely-available and community supported distribution of
OpenStack packaged and integrated for RHEL, CentOS and Fedora.

## What's RDO

* OpenStack packages
* An installer: packstack
* A deployment & management tool: RDO Manager
* __MOST IMPORTANT: A COMMUNITY__

---
class: middle

## Packstack

* Fast & simple deployment tool of OpenStack
* Handle single-node/multi-nodes configuration
* Aims at small PoCs
* Built on Puppet

## History - OpenStack in Fedora

* openstack-nova Diablo imported to Fedora 16 in August 2011 [1]
* Until now we were able to keep Fedora/OpenStack release 1:1 [2]
  + Fedora 16 includes OpenStack Diablo
  + Fedora 17 includes OpenStack Essex
  + Fedora 18 includes OpenStack Folsom
  + Fedora 19 includes OpenStack Grizzly
  + Fedora 20 includes OpenStack Havana
  + Fedora 21 includes OpenStack Icehouse
  + Fedora 22 includes OpenStack Juno
  + Fedora 23 includes OpenStack Kilo
  + Starting Fedora 24/Liberty, we only support Delorean builds for Fedora

## History - OpenStack in RHEL/CentOS

* Nova added to EPEL6 in November 2011
* complete Essex update in April 2012 [1]
* incompatible Folsom update in October 2012 [2] sparked conversations
leading to the creation of RDO [3]
* RDO started with Grizzly in April 2013
* Since september, 2014 part of the CentOS Cloud SIG

# OpenStack Packaging Challenges

---
class: middle

## Targets

* Focusing on RHEL/CentOS 7 (starting Kilo)
* Fedora supported through Delorean

---
class: middle

## Multiple Releases

* Kilo (previous stable) => may 2015
* Liberty (current stable) => october 2015
* Mitaka (master)

---
class: middle

## Many packages

For instance CentOS 7 Juno

* 641 binary packages for CentOS
* 282 source packages
* 207 python packages
* 101 source packages for openstack services
* 17 source packages for openstack clients

---
class: middle, inverse, center

# The Setup

---
class: middle

## Git

* Currently hosted on @openstack-packages github organization
* A single spec per release on one branch
  + rpm-master => Delorean (Mitaka)
  + rpm-liberty => Delorean (Liberty)
  + rdo-liberty => CentOS/RHEL (Liberty)
* Same spec is used to be built on multiple targets

---
class: middle

## Buildsystem Setup

* RDO Fedora is built in Koji, Fedora N+1 builds are made available
for Fedora N *e.g. RDO Kilo for Fedora 22 are Fedora 23 builds*
* RDO EL is built in CBS and is self-sufficient starting Kilo

---
class: middle

## Packaging/Patches review

* Using gerrit like OpenStack upstream
* Patches and packaging changes runs through a review
* Updates are submitted through a simple YAML file
* [Hosted on gerrithub](https://review.gerrithub.io/#/q/project:openstack-packages)
* Trigger a serie of CI jobs

---
class: middle

## Continuous Integration

* Phase1

Install packages from update YAML on the snapshot image with
the all-in-one OpenStack installation, starts services and runs
Tempest smoketest. Tests basic package sanity and upgrade.

* Phase2

Runs from-the-scratch all-in-one installation with all the packages
which passed Phase1. Tests package interaction among queued updates.

  + stage daily jobs and on-demand before pushing queued updates list
  +  production daily job to catch regressions in dependency changes

=> Moved to ci.centos.org

* [Repository level testing from Cloud SIG](https://ci.centos.org/job/cloud-sig-validate-packstack-rdo-kilo-testing_tag/)

## Back to the future !

class: middle

## Delorean

Tracks upstream master (currently Liberty) and stable branches now.

Breaks when upstream change requires packaging changes and alerts package owners as defined in [rdoinfo](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo)

Going forward, all packaging changes will be done in Delorean packages first, and merged to stable packaging branches

# RDO Status

---
class: middle

## Opening up the technical governance

* Public infrastructure => reviewing system, CI (WiP)
* Weekly IRC meetings on freenode ([agenda](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Packaging))
* Creation of RDO Eng. team to support and foster contributions (ping apevec or hguemar to get
started!)
* __RDO Eng. is the only team that has no internal meetings, all in the open!__
* Open roadmap ([RDO public trello](https://trello.com/b/HhXlqdiu/rdo))

---
class: middle

## Why?

* RDO has been founded as a self-supporting community distribution of OpenStack for Fedora/RHEL ecosystem
* Enable community contributors collaboration
* Allow community to choose the direction of the project

---
class: middle

## A lot more contributions from non-redhatters

Juno highlights:

* Juno/EL6 builds thanks to Thomas Oulevey (CERN)
* Barbican packages thanks to Greg Swift (Rackspace)
* GBP packages thanks to Robert Kukura (Cisco)

---
class: middle

## RDO 💓 CentOS

* RDO starting Kilo is fully built on CBS
* One of the first usable product by a SIG
* Considering moving more bits of RDO infrastructure over CentOS

---
class: middle

## RDO mid-cycle meetup

* Full day meetup during FOSDEM
* Co-located with FOSDEM CentOS dojo
* Discussion on planning and future organization

---
class: middle

## Big tent plans

* A lot of interests in maintaining non-core projects in RDO
* RDO Eng. will be supporting community efforts as long as there is commitment
* Note that won't impact RHOSP

[Projects in RDO list](https://www.rdoproject.org/ProjectsInRDO)

---
class: middle

## Packaging as an upstream project

* [Proposal cooked up at Vancouver Summit](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/185187/)
* We're 100% behind it
* Currently discussing with Suse guys on how we could converge RPM packaging
* Not a disruptive change to us as we've been working on two releases using a very
similar workflow (delorean + gerrithub)

---
class: middle

## No stable point-releases

* Upstream will stand behind stable branches ensuring that every commit is production-ready
* Allow more frequent bugfix and CVE releases in RDO
* Still need to figure out details (tarballs & changelog)

---
class: middle

## Operational tools

* Bringing mature and advanced operational tools to RDO
  + Centralised Logging
  + Performance Monitoring
  + Availability Monitoring
* Led by Graeme Gillies

[Discussion on RDO list](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00051.html)

---
class: middle

## OPNFV

* CentOS OPNFV SIG 
* Build a vanilla OPNFV platform based on OpenStack + OpenDaylight (ODL)
* First release based w/ RDO and Foreman installer coming soon
* CI + functional testing in progress
* Ping Dan Radez if you want to get involved

---
class: middle

## Khaleesi

* Ansible framework to setup OpenStack test environment
* Used by RDO and RHOSP CI
* Rewritten to be reusable by everyone

[Khaleesi](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/khaleesi)

---
class: middle

## Trystack

* Public RDO cloud available to try out OpenStack (backed by the Foundation)
* Kilo migration: WiP
* Kilo version will include Manila + Trove
* RDO CI runs over Juno
* Recruiting more operators to manage this effort!
